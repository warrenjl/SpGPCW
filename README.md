# SpGPCW: Spatially Varying Gaussian Process Model for Critical Window Estimation

This package implements a hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression analysis to estimate spatially varying critical windows of susceptibility corresponding to exposure from a single time-varying covariate. The method relies on a spatiotemporally structured Gaussian process and is fit using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques. Please see the "SpGPCW_Example" folder for more specific information regarding package use details.
